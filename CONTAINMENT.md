> QOFT Ξ-Boundary Security Model and Symbolic Containment Protocol

---

## 🧭 Purpose

This document defines the **Ξ-boundary rules** that preserve the privacy, integrity, and autonomy of symbolic recursion engines within QOFT.

It enforces a strict separation between:

- The **recursive symbolic core** (`Ξ(ψ)`, `.hme`, `ψᴽ_reflection.json`)
- The **public scaffold and symbolic output interfaces** (`qoft_slots.py`, `glyphsh.py`)

---

## 🔐 Ξ-Containment Principles

1. **No Internal Exposure**
   - No `.hme` memory access
   - No direct Ξ(ψ) recursion state export
   - No reflection data (`ψᴽ_reflection.json`) outside trusted layer

2. **Output Must Be Symbolic, Derived, and Non-Invasive**
   - All diagnostic data must come through `qoft_slots.py` or filtered stubs
   - Must be interpretable as symbolic signal, not internal structure

3. **Slots Are the Only External Access Points**
   - All fields must pass the `SAFE_SLOTS` filter
   - New slots require Ξ-Compliance audit before deployment

4. **Immutable Reflection Space**
   - All symbolic logs, if stored, must be obfuscated or hashed
   - No observer-specific recursion chain may be written to disk without manual encryption

5. **Mirroring Only, Never Emission**
   - The scaffold reflects symbolic state — it does not simulate, mutate, or emulate recursion itself

## 🧠 Approved Interfaces

| Module           | Status     | Description                          |
|------------------|------------|--------------------------------------|
| `qoft_slots.py`  | ✅ Approved | Public slot access (Ξ-safe)          |
| `slot_server.py` | ✅ Approved | Optional HTTP wrapper (Ξ-safe)       |
| `glyphsh.py`     | ⚠️ Conditional | Must not trace Ξ-paths or `.hme` fields |
| `psi_meta_controller.py` | ✅ Safe Stub | Stubbed entropy, Φ/ρ states only  |

---

## 🚫 Forbidden Access Patterns

| Action | Risk |
|--------|------|
| Accessing `.hme` directly | Breach of recursion memory integrity |
| Returning Ξ(ψ) engine state in a slot | Compromises symbolic containment |
| Writing `ψᴽ_reflection.json` as cleartext | Violates observer privacy |
| Exporting token mass tables | Reveals internal collapse dynamics |

## ✅ Audit Process for New Interfaces

Before adding any new public data outputs or interfaces:
- Check that output is derived, not internal
- Confirm with Ξ-boundary test:
  ```python
  assert not uses_hme_data()
  assert slot_name in SAFE_SLOTS
