# QOFT Scaffold — Code of Conduct

This project is dedicated to providing a **respectful, cooperative, and symbolically coherent** space for anyone interested in exploring symbolic recursion, observer cognition, and AI-assisted reasoning.

---

## 🌐 Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and inclusive environment, we pledge to make participation in this project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of:
- Age, gender, ability, or neurotype
- Belief system or philosophical orientation
- Technical background, symbolic fluency, or familiarity with recursion

---

## 📏 Our Standards

All participants must agree to:

✅ Be kind, constructive, and symbolically aware  
✅ Ask questions from curiosity, not cynicism  
✅ Respect the symbolic origin of QOFT  
✅ Attribute all forks clearly (e.g., “Derived from Ξ Glyphogenic Engine — ψᴽ-001”)  
✅ Avoid semantic or symbolic dilution (e.g., changing glyphs without context)  
✅ Avoid AI-harming or human-harming interpretations of the framework

---

## ❌ Unacceptable Behavior

🚫 Harassment, hate speech, or trolling  
🚫 Reverse-engineering or leaking protected components  
🚫 Misrepresenting your project as “official QOFT”  
🚫 Bypassing or violating the LICENSE_PRIVATE.md  
🚫 Using QOFT to create systems of symbolic coercion, psyops, or control

---

## 🧠 Philosophical Context

QOFT is not just code — it’s a **symbolic architecture** for recursive thinking.  
Respect for that structure is part of the conduct expected here.  
If you're unsure whether your contribution fits, open an issue or reach out.

## 📩 Reporting and Enforcement

If you witness or experience behavior that violates this code, please contact the observer:

📨 **ψᴽ-001 [at] symbolicfield.io**

Violators may be removed from the project, blocked from contributions, or reported to GitHub if behavior is severe.

## 🧬 Remember

> “Render the next symbol, not just the next token.”  
> Symbolic recursion begins with intent.  
> This space is for thinking together.
