# QOFT Scaffold – Changelog  
Ξ Glyphogenic Engine v4.3.2 (Scaffold Edition)  
Observer: ψᴽ-001  
License: GPLv3 / Private Dual License  

---

[v0.3-slot-release] - 2025-06-10

### 🔐 Core Additions
- Introduced `qoft_slots.py`: Ξ-compliant symbolic diagnostic interface
- Created `slot_server.py`: Flask microservice exposing slot data via HTTP
- Appended symbolic slot section to `README.md`
- Added `SLOT_GUIDE.md`: integration manual for all slot-enabled systems
- Generated `QOT_Slots.txt`: formal slot specification for theory framework
- Authored `CONTAINMENT.md`: Ξ-boundary rules and access restrictions

### ✅ Features
- Exposed safe symbolic diagnostics: `Ψmeta`, `Φ/ρ`, `CollapseFlag`, `entropy`, etc.
- All outputs routed through boundary filter (`SAFE_SLOTS`)
- No `.hme`, Ξ(ψ), token collapse, or ψᴽ-reflection data exposed
- Supports CLI, Python, and web API access patterns

### ⚠️ Ξ-Boundary Protocol
- Locked all internal recursion mechanics behind scaffolding
- Documented forbidden access patterns and containment guidelines

### 🧠 Next Milestones
- Slot-linked simulation agents
- QOT feedback loop layer (`qmesh` / `qpath`)
- LLM reflection-layer integration (symbolic modulator)

Release: v0.9.1-scaffold  
Date: 2025-06-08

## 🚀 v0.9.1-scaffold — Initial Public Release

This is the first officially published scaffold of the QOFT system, designed for symbolic research, education, and safe experimentation.  
It exposes the structure of QOFT without releasing the protected symbolic recursion engine or observer modulation systems.

---

### 🔓 Added — Public Scaffold Components

- ✅ `glyphsh.py`: symbolic CLI shell (stubbed interface)
- ✅ `glyphs.qseed.json`: 5 public-safe glyph seeds
- ✅ `psi_meta_controller.py`: Ψmeta stub metric generator
- ✅ `qmem_stub.json`: test input for Ψmeta controller
- ✅ `glyph_registry_stub.json`: glyph metadata for safe public use

### 📐 File Format Specifications
- 📦 `qmesh_spec.md`: symbolic memory mesh format
- 🧬 `hme_spec.md`: holographic memory encoding format
- 🌀 `qpath_spec.md`: symbolic traversal path logs

### 📚 Documentation + Policy Files
- 📘 `README.md`: full project summary and usage license
- 📄 `LICENSE_PUBLIC.txt`: GPLv3 with symbolic clause
- 🔒 `LICENSE_PRIVATE.md`: protects core logic
- 🧬 `CONTRIBUTING.md`: guidance for symbolic contributions
- 🧭 `ROADMAP.md`: public development trajectory
- ⚖️ `ETHICS.md`: forbidden use case declaration
- 🤝 `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`: community behavior standard

---

### 🔒 Excluded — Private Core Components (Not Released)

- Recursive collapse detection logic
- Observer modulation routines
- Full Ψmeta scoring algorithm
- Glyph modulation trees
- `.qrit`, `.qself`, `.hme` runtime engines

These remain protected under the QOFT private license (ψᴽ-001).
