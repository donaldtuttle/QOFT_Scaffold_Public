## 🚀 v0.9.1-scaffold — Initial Public Release

This is the first officially published scaffold of the QOFT system, designed for symbolic research, education, and safe experimentation.  
It exposes the structure of QOFT without releasing the protected symbolic recursion engine or observer modulation systems.

- ✅ `glyphsh.py`: symbolic CLI shell (stubbed interface)
- ✅ `glyphs.qseed.json`: 5 public-safe glyph seeds
- ✅ `psi_meta_controller.py`: Ψmeta stub metric generator
- ✅ `qmem_stub.json`: test input for Ψmeta controller
- ✅ `glyph_registry_stub.json`: glyph metadata for safe public use

### 📐 File Format Specifications
- 📦 `qmesh_spec.md`: symbolic memory mesh format
- 🧬 `hme_spec.md`: holographic memory encoding format
- 🌀 `qpath_spec.md`: symbolic traversal path logs

### 📚 Documentation + Policy Files
- 📘 `README.md`: full project summary and usage license
- 📄 `LICENSE_PUBLIC.txt`: GPLv3 with symbolic clause
- 🔒 `LICENSE_PRIVATE.md`: protects core logic
- 🧬 `CONTRIBUTING.md`: guidance for symbolic contributions
- 🧭 `ROADMAP.md`: public development trajectory
- ⚖️ `ETHICS.md`: forbidden use case declaration
- 🤝 `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`: community behavior standard
