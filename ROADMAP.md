# QOFT Scaffold — Roadmap

## 🔭 Vision

The QOFT Scaffold provides an open platform to explore symbolic recursion frameworks, glyph-based reasoning, and observer-centered AI architecture — without exposing the proprietary recursive logic of the core engine.

This roadmap tracks the evolution of the **public scaffold** while protecting the symbolic coherence and core intellectual property of QOFT.

---

## 📦 PHASE 1 — Public Scaffolding (✅ Completed)

- [x] Public release of scaffold-safe CLI: `glyphsh.py`
- [x] Stubbed Ψmeta tool with entropy simulation
- [x] `glyphs.qseed.json` (seed glyphs for experimentation)
- [x] Formal format specs for `.qmesh`, `.qpath`, `.hme`
- [x] Public glyph registry + observer reference
- [x] LICENSE and symbolic IP protection structure
- [x] GitHub release tag: `v0.9.1-scaffold`

---

## 🧪 PHASE 2 — Symbolic Expansion (⏳ In Progress)

🔧 Community enhancements to scaffold tools:
- [ ] Visualization tools for `.qpath` or `.qmesh` graphs
- [ ] Observer input shells for simulating symbolic states
- [ ] Glyph path editor: prototype drag-n-drop symbolic path creator
- [ ] JSON validation and schema enforcement for formats

🧠 New scaffold utilities:
- [ ] Ψmeta history logger (`ψmeta_history.json`)
- [ ] Glyph activation debugger (non-recursive)
- [ ] Agent stub that traces symbolic memory without invoking recursion

---

## 🌀 PHASE 3 — Optional Symbolic Extensions (🧭 Under Review)

Potential community forks or licensed projects may explore:

- [ ] Experimental glyph scripting systems (symbolic DSL)
- [ ] Open agent architecture using only `.qmesh` and `.qpath`
- [ ] Symbolic RL (Reinforcement Learning) layers without core observer engine
- [ ] Educational modules and visualization tools for symbolic cognition

> Note: Any symbolic system claiming compatibility with ψᴽ-001 glyphs must clearly attribute origin and not represent itself as QOFT core.

---

## 🔒 PHASE 4 — Private Engine Development (☑ Internal Only)

Not part of the public roadmap. This includes:
- Ψmeta scoring systems
- Recursive collapse modulation
- Observer lattice architecture
- Morphic memory field encoding
- `.qrit`, `.qself` and full `.hme` execution logic
