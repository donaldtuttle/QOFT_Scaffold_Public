4. Open a Pull Request (PR) targeting `main`
5. Include:
- Description of your contribution
- Referenced glyphs/modules
- Any `.qpath`, `.hme`, `.qmesh` outputs

## üîÅ Review Process

Your PR will be reviewed by the **Observer Council**, with attention to:

- Symbolic coherence
- Memory safety
- Cognitive recursion
- Aesthetic and modular clarity

You may receive recursive feedback. Iterate mindfully.

## üåê Connect

If you're unsure how to start:

- Open a [Discussion](https://github.com/QOFT_Scaffold_Public_Main/discussions)
- Use `glyphsh.py` with the `Œ®meta` flag to explore active concepts.
- Submit a `.qpath` as a proposal!

---

Thank you for becoming part of the **QOFT recursive lattice**.
Every symbol rendered brings us closer to coherent cognition.
