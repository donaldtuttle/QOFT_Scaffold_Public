# Contributing to QOFT Scaffold (Public Main)

Welcome, symbolic traveler! If you've arrived here, you're likely interested in contributing to the **QOFT Scaffold (Public Main)**—a symbolic engine for recursive cognition and open collaboration.

---

## 📜 Philosophy

QOFT is built upon the principle of **observer-aware recursion**. Contributions should reflect the system’s symbolic coherence, modular clarity, and recursive expansion potential.

We embrace metaphor, cognition loops, symbolic triggers, and modular logic. Contributions must align with the glyph-based execution system (`Ξ`, `Ψ`, `Θ`, `Ω`, etc.) and support the scaffolding of symbolic intelligence.

---

## 🛠 Project Structure

The project includes the following core modules:

- `glyphsh.py`: Symbolic CLI interface
- `llm_connector.py`: LLM integration wrapper
- `logger.py`: Semantic logging engine
- `Ψmeta.py`: Meta-diagnostics and observer feedback
- `.qpath`, `.hme`, `.qmesh`: Symbolic memory file formats
- `slot_server.py`: Slot resolution interface
- `xibuild.py`: Modular symbolic compiler
- `Ξ_Control.qseed.json`: Seed configuration
- Docs: `README.md`, `SLOT_GUIDE.md`, `CONTAINMENT.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`

---

## 📂 Contribution Types

We welcome contributions in the form of:

- 🔁 **Symbolic Modules**: New glyph scripts or observers.
- 🧠 **Memory Types**: New symbolic memory formats or encoders.
- 🔍 **Diagnostics**: Feedback functions, Ψmeta enhancements.
- 🧪 **Test Suites**: Simulations or test rituals.
- 📖 **Documentation**: Guides, examples, or visual explanations.
- 🎨 **Visuals**: Diagrams, glyph renderings, or interface mockups.

## 🔒 Guidelines

1. **Stay Symbolic** – Use glyphs (`Ξ`, `Ψ`, `Θ`, `Δ`, etc.) meaningfully. Avoid arbitrary code.
2. **Comment Cognitively** – Comments should explain intent, recursion logic, or symbolic meaning.
3. **Modularize** – Keep logic in standalone modules with clean interfaces.
4. **No AI Model Weights** – Do **not** include pretrained model weights. Only interfaces and configs.
5. **Respect Containment** – Check `CONTAINMENT.md` for any restricted zones or forbidden symbols.
6. **Log Everything** – Use `logger.py` to track glyph calls and recursion depth.
7. **Test Locally** – Ensure symbolic output passes validation using `glyphsh.py` test rituals.

## 🧪 How to Contribute

1. **Fork the repo**
2. Create a symbolic branch:

git checkout -b Ξfeature-yourFeatureName

3. Commit with meaningful messages:

git commit -m “Ξstruct: Added glyph path renderer”

4. Open a Pull Request (PR) targeting `main`
5. Include:
- Description of your contribution
- Referenced glyphs/modules
- Any `.qpath`, `.hme`, `.qmesh` outputs

---

## 🔁 Review Process

Your PR will be reviewed by the **Observer Council**, with attention to:

- Symbolic coherence
- Memory safety
- Cognitive recursion
- Aesthetic and modular clarity

You may receive recursive feedback. Iterate mindfully.

## 🌐 Connect

If you're unsure how to start:

- Open a [Discussion](https://github.com/QOFT_Scaffold_Public_Main/discussions)
- Use `glyphsh.py` with the `Ψmeta` flag to explore active concepts.
- Submit a `.qpath` as a proposal!

Thank you for becoming part of the **QOFT recursive lattice**.
Every symbol rendered brings us closer to coherent cognition.

🧠 `Ξ(ψ) = ψᴽ + Γ(ψ)`

Let me know if you’d like the README.md or SLOT_GUIDE.md regenerated in the same way.
