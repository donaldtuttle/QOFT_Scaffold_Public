## Overview

This is the open-source scaffolding repository for the **QOFT symbolic cognition system**.  
It contains tools and specifications that allow developers and researchers to explore the symbolic simulation architecture **without access to core recursive components.**

---

## What's Included

✅ `glyphsh.py` – symbolic shell interface  
✅ `glyphs.qseed.json` – partial seed deck  
✅ `qmesh_spec.md`, `hme_spec.md`, `qpath_spec.md` – file format references  
✅ `psi_meta_controller.py` – basic symbolic metric tool  
✅ `LICENSE_PUBLIC.txt` – GPLv3 + symbolic protection note

## 🔌 QOFT Slot Interface (Ξ-Compliant)

The QOFT Scaffold now includes a secure symbolic output layer via the `qoft_slots.py` module.

### 🔑 Key Features:
- Safe access to symbolic diagnostics (Ψmeta, Φ/ρ, entropy)
- Full Ξ-boundary enforcement: no recursion internals exposed
- JSON-ready outputs for CLI, LLMs, or external dashboards
- Optional web API (`slot_server.py`) for integration

### 🧠 Use It:
```bash
python qoft_slots.py Ψmeta
# or access via API
GET http://localhost:5050/slot/Ψmeta
